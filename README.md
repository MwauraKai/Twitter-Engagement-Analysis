# Twitter Engagement Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents an analysis of Twitter data to gain insights into user engagement. The project explores likes and retweets distribution, category analysis, and temporal trends. The analysis was performed using Python, including libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project also involved accessing Twitter data without using APIs due to access limitations.

## Key Findings
- Distribution of likes and retweets.
- Category-wise analysis to identify popular topics.
- Temporal trends analysis based on day of the week and hour.
- Insights into user engagement patterns.

## Methodology
### Data Loading
- Loaded Twitter data into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.

### Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values (none found).
- Removed duplicate rows.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed distribution of likes and retweets.
- Explored user engagement trends over time.

## Reflections
The project faced challenges in accessing Twitter APIs, leading to an alternative approach for data collection. The choice of data analysis libraries aimed to provide a seamless and insightful exploration of the dataset. The project's focus on user engagement provides valuable information for understanding audience behavior on the platform.
